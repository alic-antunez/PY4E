 MOOC: Python For Everyone

I am very happy to finish the Data Structure course taught by Dr. Charles Severance from the University of Michigan.You will be able to see my solutions to some of the assignments during the course. Mainly so that it is visible to you and you can give me feedback on my solution.

I highly recommend this wonderful course to you. Dr. Chuck's way of teaching is unique and makes you understand the basics of Python programming in a simple way.

What you will learn in this course:
-> Install Python and write your first program
-> Describe the basics of the Python programming language
-> Use variables to store, retrieve and calculate information
-> Utilize core programming tools such as functions and loops
-> Explain the principles of data structures & how they are used
-> Create programs that are able to read and write data from files
-> Store data as key/value pairs using Python dictionaries
-> Accomplish multi-step tasks like sorting or looping using tuples
